# BloodLink

This project was a help to a friend at college. He studies medicine and is originally from Pakistan, where blood donation infrastructure isn't perfect. He was in talks with some hospitals local to his home and asked me to develop a simple app to broadcast and accept calls for blood donation. Here it is:

# I learnt

* Java
* How to develop frontends with Material Design
* How to use Android Studio
* HTTP get, HTTP post and friends
* That I've got a really good intuition about what makes a user-friendly UI
* Personal project fail almost every time. If you make an effort to learn tools properly (by reading a book), you can improve the lower bound on the worth of the outcome AND make your life easier. 

Frontend design has actually changed a lot since then. At this point I wasn't aware of (e.g) React Native. In hindsight I should've written the app in JS and converted it to run on Android and iOS.
